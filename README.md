# Welcome to your repo

This is a personal repo. It will house all 1:1 notes, documented goals/growth things, and anything else important.

## How does it work?

Every Monday, a GitHub action creates a PR within a a markdown file containing questions about the week ahead. We can each add notes to this as they come to mind, and then during our 1:1 can reference them and add new notes and to-dos. At the end of the week, you can review and merge the PR, marking the notes seen and complete.

Meeting notes are saved in this private repo. They are very helpful to refer back to for both of us during review season. Only the two of us have access to this repo. If you get a new manager, with your permission, I can transfer the repo over so that you can have a consistent process, and so that your new manager can have access to previous notes.
