# Automated 1:1s
This is a template for a weekly 1:1 repo.

## How does it work?

Each of my direct reports has their own private repo that only the two of us have access to.

Every Monday, a GitHub action creates a draft PR with a markdown file containing questions about the week ahead. We can each add notes to this as they come to mind, and then during our 1:1 can reference them and add new notes and to-dos. At the end of the week, the report can review and merge the PR, marking the notes seen and complete.

Meeting notes are saved in this private repo. They are very helpful to refer back to for both of us during review season. If they get a new manager, with the report's permission, I can transfer the repo over so they can have a consistent process, and so that the new manager can have access to previous notes.
